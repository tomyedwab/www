<p>Statistics: The science of producing unreliable facts from reliable figures. -Evan Esar</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a trendy practice being advocated in a number of software development
teams, which is to measure everything<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> and A/B test radical ideas<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. It sounds good on paper: Instead of crowding together in a
meeting room and debating pros and cons or relying on a designer to make all the
decisions, why not let the customers vote with their clicks? On the other hand,
there are some outspoken critics of A/B testing who claim that it marginalizes
good design<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> and it leads to bad decision-making<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> in many cases. At Khan Academy,
a company that provides a free service to a global population diverse in age and
nationality, there is really no way to know what the effect of many of our
changes will be except to try them and measure the results.</p>
<p>The result of our experiments thus far boils down to this:</p>
<p>Data is easy to collect but hard to interpret, never giving you a clear result
that confirms your hypotheses. However, even noisy and confusing data is
invaluable in forming and testing hypotheses about user behavior.</p>
<p>Long story short, so far the best we've gotten is some comfort knowing we
haven't made things worse, and maybe a little insight into how users behave
contrary to our expectations.</p>
<h2>Process</h2>
<p>Last week at Khan Academy we completed a sequence of experiments over a few
months aimed at improving navigation through the site. On this project we
intentionally divided the work into small shippable changes so we could observe
the changes in user behavior. Why is this process important? Because we as
developers are biased by our prior knowledge of how the site works and how we
want it to work, and the best direct user feedback we can hope for is a vocal
minority<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>. We will tend to err on the side of changing everything, and the
vocal minority tend to be those highly invested in the status quo. Therefore,
we need objective measurements of how visitors to the site behave and how this
changes over time.
over time.</p>
<p>Our data collection is as comprehensive as possible: we report user actions to
Google Analytics and MixPanel. We also collect conversion data for A/B tests
using GAE/Bingo<sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>. After each deploy, we monitored all these statistics for a week
to see the effect of the changes on both weekend and weekday traffic, which can
differ dramatically. Then we took the results into account when deciding the
next steps.</p>
<h2>Long list of links</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org">khanacademy.org</a> homepage is a textbook
example of a KISS<sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup> solution that doesn't scale especially well. When you
click the "Watch" link you get this:</p>
<p><img alt="Long list of links" src="../images/12-05-02/KAHomepage.png" /></p>
<p>(It has since been taken down, and many mouse scroll wheels cried out in relief)</p>
<p>Rather than diving in and trying to improve things, we started by trying to
understand user behavior. How effective was this layout (long page full of text
links with a sticky navigation header at the top of the screen) at getting users
to the video content they are looking for? Here is some sample data from
MixPanel:</p>
<p><img alt="MixPanel funnel" src="../images/12-05-02/MixPanel.png" /></p>
<p>What you see here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Of all the users in the sample who landed on the homepage, 22.29% selected a
  topic from the topic browser. (There are other ways to get to videos, but it's
  useful to know what subset of the population we're looking at)</li>
<li>Of those who clicked on the topic browser, 80.67% clicked on a video in the
  Big List of Links.</li>
<li>Of those who clicked on a video, 86.71% started watching the video.</li>
<li>Of those who started watching a video, 74.27% completed it.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is clearly a lot of room for improvement here.</p>
<h2>The fun part</h2>
<p>So now we come to the changes we've been rolling out. Since I last wrote about
our topics reorganization in February, there have been two major changes tested
and shipped that take advantage of the new structure:</p>
<p><img alt="The Watch Menu" src="../images/12-05-02/KAwatchmenu.png" />
<img alt="The Algebra Topic Page" src="../images/12-05-02/KAtopicpage.png" /></p>
<p>The Watch menu replaced the link that takes you to the top of the video list
with a drop-down menu of topics that initially navigated you to the specific
topic you selected, and eventually to the relevant topic page once those were
released.</p>
<p>Topic pages were designed carefully to help visitors find content faster without
overwhelming them with thousands of video titles. They are also a big step
forward visually - I am particularly proud of the
<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-history">Art History</a> page. Go on,
have a look. Isn't it beautiful?</p>
<p>Aside from helping visitors get their bearings, topic pages afford many
secondary benefits: They are easy to bookmark and link to, they can load much
faster than the homepage, they can be included in site search results, and they
can be indexed directly by search engines. As we build new features based on
topics, they will naturally be surfaced here, and doing further A/B tests on
these pages is easier than doing them on the homepage.</p>
<h2>The results</h2>
<p>Here is a chart of some of our key video conversion results for topic pages:</p>
<p><img alt="Result statistics" src="../images/12-05-02/KAchart.png" /></p>
<p>The columns show data for "supertopic" pages (such as Algebra), "subtopic" pages
(such as Solving Linear Equations), and "content topic" pages (such as Finance,
which has no subtopics) as well as the homepage topic browser for comparison.
The top three rows show the percentage of visitors who clicked on, started, and
completed a single video. The bottom three rows show the retention rates between
steps.</p>
<p>There are two things to notice here:</p>
<ul>
<li>The retention rates after the visitor has clicked on a video link are marginally
  better than on the homepage. This seems good.</li>
<li>The click-through rate is quite a bit lower in some cases than the topic browser
  on the homepage. This seems bad.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two contradictory trends roughly cancel each other out in the final number
of visitors completing a video! Obviously, we were hoping for a significant
improvement in overall conversions and we aren't seeing one.</p>
<h2>The analysis</h2>
<p>Our general attitude at Khan Academy is to ship often and adjust course as
necessary, and this is a tacit admission that no plan survives contact with the
user base. The thing that has amazed me more than anything else about this is
how similar the conversion numbers are even when comparing between completely
different pages and navigation styles! While the numbers aren't an obvious
home-run, we can see that those visitors who found a video were more likely to
watch it, which is a sign that indeed they are more easily finding the video
that they are looking for. And while the slightly lower initial click-through
rate could be improved, the number of visitors to the topic pages seems to be
rising over time, and with it the total number of clicks on video links from
topic pages.</p>
<p>It's also important to step back from the numbers for a bit and look at the big
picture: Topic pages give us more flexibility for future features, they are a
better experience for navigation than the homepage, and we can get massive SEO
benefits from of them. Analytics is just one part of the decision-making
process, and one we are taking with a grain of salt while we continue to try to
better understand it. I'm really happy with how this project turned out and look
forward to sharing our next amazing contributions to online education.</p>
