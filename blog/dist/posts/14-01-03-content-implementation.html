            <h1>Implementation: A new content store for Khan Academy</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Written January 3, 2014</p>
        </div>
        <article>
<p>This article provides more implementation details for our versioned content
store. To see the motivating challenges and overall design for building a
versioned content store in App Engine, see the <a href="./14-01-03-content-store.html">companion blog
post</a>.</p>
<p>The truth is, once I had a rough design for a Git-alike content store, the main
challenges were all implementation details and attention to
backward-compatibility (I had to add the new versioning system incrementally
without any downtime in the editing tools or - God forbid - for site users). The
simplicity owed a lot to the Git storage model (storing versions of entities
labeled by their SHA-1 hash), which aligns neatly with the way App Engine's High
Replication Datastore likes to store and access data. There were just a few
issues to work out, and I'll list them here.</p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>The simplest way to implement a Git-like store in App Engine is to create a
db/ndb Model class for the object you'd like to store with the properties you'd
like to store and a method for creating new revisions of that model. Unlike
traditional entities which are overwritten whenever a change is made, in this
case you create a completely new entity (a "revision") on every change. This
might sound wasteful compared to storing diffs, but the invariant that revisions
are immutable makes the implementation easier and enables easy caching of
revisions. This is one example where we rely on App Engine's scalability to make
our lives easier, and compared to the hundreds of millions of user-generated
data items, the number of entities here will be relatively small. If this keeps
you up at night you can always prune orphaned revisions later.</p>
<p>One decision we made fairly early on was to keep editing models (revisions)
separate from the live models that the site uses. The primary reason for this
was that we had live entities already (Video and Exercise), and finding all the
places where we fetch them by key would have been an onerous and error-prone
task. This choice turned out to have some other advantages as well. So the
inheritance tree looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="A diagram showing BaseVideo, VersionedContent, and BaseRevision classes. Video inherits from VersionedContent and BaseVideo, and VideoRevision inherits from BaseRevision and BaseVideo." class="article-width" src="../images/14-01-03/content_infrastructure.png" /></p>
<p>BaseVideo is a plain Python class that store the common DB properties and
methods between the editing version (VideoRevision) and the run-time published
version (Video). Common functionality for working with live content and
revisions is in VersionedContent and BaseRevision, respectively. In our case, we
could not make BaseVideo a PolyModel (as that would have changed the kind and
therefore invalidate all the existing keys) so we had to introduce a metaclass
to allow the subclasses to share DB properties. This enables us to add
properties to VersionedContent and BaseRevision that will be inherited by
subclasses. I will use Video/VideoRevision as my examples from now on, but
everything stated applies equally to our other content types.</p>
<p>As in Git, the (key) ID of the VideoRevision is a hex-encoded SHA-1 hash of the
contents of the object, which in this case is a JSON representation of the
entity's fields. There is also a string property which references the Video's
key ID, so we can track history and keep references to an object across
revisions. When we create a VideoRevision for a new video, we generate a random
ID, ensuring that a new Video entity will be created at publish time. Note that
there may be many VideoRevision entities for a single video (tracking historical
changes) but there is only ever one Video entity, preserving the current ability
of published entities to reference each other by datastore key. The Video also
contains the key ID of its latest VideoRevision that has been published; that
is, the fields of both should be the same.</p>
<p>This means that to find the latest revision of an object, we need a table of
content ID → revision ID. This is the "stage" (or sandbox), which represents the
current editing state.</p>
<p>So, to make an edit to an object:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look up the latest edit version of the object in the stage (this is a
  get-by-key, which is very efficient)</li>
<li>Apply the requested changes</li>
<li>Compute a new revision ID from the updated properties</li>
<li>Create the new revision entity with the revision ID as its key ID and put it
  into the datastore</li>
<li>Update the stage to point to the new revision ID</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the content author is done making changes, they can create a commit, which
is just a snapshot of the stage at a particular moment in time, freezing the
revision IDs to specific values. The commit contains an author ID and commit
message, and it references the previous "head" commit, forming a chain of
changes that can be used to recover the entire history of the content. The
commit becomes the new "head" commit and is automatically queued up to be
published to the site.</p>
<p>This is what the whole setup looks like after a commit:</p>
<p><img alt="A diagram showing a ContentCommit indexing the editing revisions, which update
the published entities." src="../images/14-01-03/Atlas_versioning.png" /></p>
<p>And here is what it looks like after a second commit, where three of the four
entities have been changed:</p>
<p><img alt="Another diagram similar to the last but with an additional ContentCommit
referencing the first while updating several content
revisions." src="../images/14-01-03/Atlas_versioning_2.png" /></p>
<p>Having the snapshot and commits be tables of revision IDs means that doing a
diff is very efficient: just look for entries that differ between the two
tables, fetch only those revisions, and diff their properties. This makes it
easy to recompute values or invalidate caches based on just the content that has
changed without having to compare old and new properties for every piece of
content.</p>
<h2>Publishing</h2>
<p>At its core, publishing a commit to the site involves identifying which content
revisions have changed (by comparing the revision IDs in the commits' tables),
fetching those revisions, and copying their fields onto the corresponding live
entities, creating any entities that don't already exist. Then the "currently
published commit" setting is updated, which instantaneously changes the version
of the entities that all the user-facing handlers look at when rendering the
site, and you're done. The process works equally well for rolling back to an
earlier commit.</p>
<p>Publishing is also a great place for denormalizing data. Since Video and
VideoRevision are separate models, we can add properties to just Video (such as
the canonical URL) that are calculated and saved on the entity during publish.
We can also pre-warm some caches that are invalidated on each publish, so that
users never see a cache miss.</p>
<p>Separating live entities from editing entities does add some complexity to the
system, but after publish we can now reference a Video by its key (which is
stable) or we can run datastore queries on its indexed fields, neither of which
we could have done with just the revisions.</p>
<h2>Sync / merge</h2>
<p>Because of the simplicity of the versioning system, if I want to import the
latest copy of the topic tree to my local dev datastore, all I need to do is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the latest commit from the live site,</li>
<li>Make a list of the revision entities that I don't have,</li>
<li>Download the revisions in bulk and push them directly into my datastore</li>
<li>Set the downloaded commit as the "head" commit</li>
</ul>
<p>From there I can do a normal publish and everything should behave identically to
the way it does on live. If I make local changes, I can run the same process on
the live site to pull the changes back up.</p>
<p>It is possible that the commit that has been synced is not a descendant of the
local head commit (there have been changes both locally and remotely since the
last sync). In this case we can create a "merge" commit which finds the common
ancestor and then performs an automatic three-way merge between them. The
algorithm is trivial when no entity has been modified in both branches, but it's
still possible do a field-by-field merge, which should cover a majority of
cases. This allows us to copy all our content to a new datastore, make some
changes, publish and preview them, and then merge those changes back to the live
site automatically.</p>
<h2>tl;dr</h2>
<p>I wanted to go into some detail to give you an idea of the design decisions and
trade-offs we made on the road to having a flexible, extensible versioning
system that works efficiently on App Engine. Some of these decisions are
specific to our particular situation, but a lot of these ideas could be
generally useful in building a CMS on a NoSQL-type platform like Google's.</p>
<p>If you find yourself using these patterns please drop me a line and let me know
how it's working for you.</p>
