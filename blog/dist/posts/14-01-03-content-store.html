<p>Over the past two years, I've been working largely behind the scenes at Khan
Academy on the infrastructure the content team uses to upload and publish
content (videos, exercises, articles, and interactive programs) to the site.
Most of the changes I've made over the past year are not directly visible to
users of the site but without them we could not produce the quality and quantity
of lessons we need to provide a "world-class education for anyone, anywhere".
One of our strengths as a company is knowing when to hack something together and
when to invest in flexible and extensible systems, and I would like to share the
solution that we've come up with in case others find it useful.</p>
<h2>Context</h2>
<p><img alt="A desk on top of a desk, alongside a chair on top of a chair" class="article-width" src="../images/14-01-03/cramped-spaces.jpg" />
Creative solutions for cramped spaces</p>
<p>When I first arrived at Khan Academy's humble office (devs huddled around one
long table, with the implementations team occupying the single conference room)
the content situation was this: playlists of videos were downloaded directly
from Sal Khan's YouTube account<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, and there was a single editor for the exercises
on the knowledge map, changes to which would show up on the live site
immediately upon saving. These entities: Video, VideoPlaylist, and Exercise,
were the basis for everything on the site. There was no versioning, no
organization, and no direct editing - if Sal wanted to fix a typo in a video
title he had to do it in YouTube, and only he had access.</p>
<p>Fast forward a year. We have content from a half dozen content creators teaching
math, science, and art history. We've added the concept of a topic tree to
organize the content that any developer can edit, and a conceptually simple
versioning system: edits are made to an "editing" copy of the tree, and when the
version is published, a full copy of it is made that becomes the new editing
version. All runtime code instantly switches to using the newly "live" version
via a global setting. The system works fairly well, and we are able to build new
functionality on top of it: topic pages, power mode for exercises in a topic,
and tutorial navigation.</p>
<p><img alt="A balloon shark hovering over a row of cubicles" class="article-centered" src="../images/14-01-03/shark.jpg" /></p>
<p>However, last fall it was already becoming clear that the system just wouldn't
scale. As we brought on more content creators, coordination become more and more
of an issue: hitting publish at the wrong time could push out someone else's
in-progress changes, and there was no way to see who was currently making edits
or who had edited something in the past. As a stopgap measure, a HipChat room
was set up to coordinate publishes. As the number of topics in the topic tree
grew, publish times ballooned to an unreasonable 45 minutes (owing partly to the
need to duplicate all the topic entities and update their child keys), during
which time no editing could happen. Rolling content back was a difficult, manual
process. Furthermore, many errors were caught only at publish time, allowing one
author's simple oversight to block others from getting their changes out.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of a tree view showing a number of US math courses" class="article-centered" src="../images/14-01-03/topic_tree.png" /></p>
<p>Experienced developers tend to prefer incremental improvements over rewriting
from scratch <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, but in this case after some discussion we decided to
re-architect the system to one that could fulfill not only our current needs,
but our aspirations. We want the best and the brightest teachers to share their
knowledge on our platform, whether it's Andover teaching calculus or the Getty
and MoMa inspiring a generation of art students. Having to coordinate between
creators is a bottleneck, and having to wait an hour for content to appear on
the site is untenable. At the same time, our growing dev team is adding features
at an ever-increasing rate, and they need something stable and flexible to build
on.</p>
<p>When looking at various CMS storage and versioning designs, I tried to keep the
primary user in mind. Since the infrastructure should always be invisible to
content creators, the primary users are in fact the developers who are building
features on top of it. When it comes to versioning and deployment, developers
are used to code versioning systems, so I opted to start with a design based
entirely on Git<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, a popular distributed revision control system.</p>
<p>In the context of content management on App Engine, the Git model has distinct
advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Git's storage model is basically a key value store, with the SHA-1 hash of
  the data as the key. This maps really well to App Engine's datastore API.</li>
<li>Git stores references to a snapshot of each object on each commit, so we never
  have to apply a diff or walk the history to see how something looked at a
  given point in time, but the hash-based reference structure mean we don't have
  to duplicate objects that haven't changed between commits.</li>
<li>Using hashes as keys means that changes made on one machine can be easily
  merged with changes from another, which is critical in a distributed
  environment. For instance, adding a new object generates a random key that
  cannot collide with any other new object.</li>
<li>By design, it is easy to pull and merge changes between copies of the
  repository. This makes operations such as syncing a development copy of the
  site with production as easy as copying over any new keys and setting the head
  commit pointer.</li>
<li>Also by design, calculating a diff between any two commits is easy - just
  compare hashes for each object. This means that publish can incrementally
  update only objects that have changed, speeding up the process considerably.</li>
<li>This works equally well for rolling back to an earlier version.</li>
<li>The Git content storage filesystem model is really simple<sup id="fnref2:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> to understand and
  implement.</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn't copy Git's design wholesale, nor did I actually expose a Git-compatible
API (although it would be really cool to someday be able to check out our
content as a repository; it would give us access to a whole bunch of useful
tools). However I did find that having a fully working design to crib from made
implementation much easier and helped me explain the inner workings to other
developers.</p>
<p>So far I've been very happy with the way this system has functioned. It is
flexible, so we can implement various versioning or permissions schemes on top
of it. Different content types use this system in slightly different ways, and
that's fine. Building helpful tools such as diff viewers and remote syncing on
top of this infrastructure is really easy, and we could get as fancy as we want
to support branching &amp; merging, pull requests from third parties, etc. Most
importantly, developers other than me can jump in and create their own versioned
entities without a lot of help from me, and get their code working in a very
short time, eliminating a dependency on me when implementing new features.</p>
<p>This new architecture also enabled me to reach the goal I had set for myself:
publishes now complete in about a minute. This has had a profound impact on how
it feels to author content for the site.</p>

<p>If you're curious about the details of the implementation, I will go into sordid
detail in a <a href="./14-01-03-content-implementation.html">companion blog post</a>.</p>
